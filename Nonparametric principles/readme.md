2. Keywords: Nonparametric (Np) regression
    - comments: kNN, kernel methods, regulation, many things are related to Np regression.
    

APPLICATIONS:

1. Keywords of First Topic: `Nonparametric`, `seemingly unrelated regression (or SUR)` 
    - Academic Paper 1 : [Nonparametric seemingly unrelated regression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440760000018X) 
      * > When dealing with `simultaneous equations model`, we usually use `Feasible Generalized NLS` to estimate the model. However, this method requires strong assumption on the parameter structure of the model. This paper is a remedy.
      * [Implementation part 1: estimation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/brbisheng/Econ-Stat-Methods/blob/master/Nonparametric/Paper1/np_sur_part_1.html). This is generated by Rmarkdown, some mathematical formula can not be displayed properly. But it should be very clear to recover them if you follow closely the paper.
      * [Implementation part 2: results evaluations. (working on progress)]()
