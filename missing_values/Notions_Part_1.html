Intentional missing data
Unintentional missing data. 

Intentional missing data are planned by the data collector. For example, the data of a unit can be missing because the
unit was excluded from the sample. Another form of intentional missing data
is the use of dierent versions of the same instrument for dierent subgroups,
an approach known as matrix sampling. See Gonzalez and Eltinge (2007)
for an overview. Also, missing data that occur because of the routing in a
questionnaire are intentional, as well as data (e.g., survival times) that are
censored data at some time because the event (e.g., death) has not yet taken
place.
Though often foreseen, unintentional missing data are unplanned and not
under the control of the data collector. Examples are: the respondent skipped
an item, there was an error in the data transmission causing data to be missing,
some of the objects dropped out before the study could be completed resulting
in partially complete data, and the respondent was sampled but refused to
cooperate.

Item nonresponse: Item nonresponse refers to the situation in which the respondent skipped one or more items in the survey, item nonresponse primarily addressed by edit and imputation techniques.

Unit nonresponse: Unit nonresponse occurs if the respondent refused to participate, so all outcome data are missing for this respondent. unit nonresponse are primarily addressed by weighting methods.
