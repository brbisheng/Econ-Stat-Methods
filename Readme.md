Recently, I started a (long-term) freelance project: Algorithms from scratch. This page is dedicated to implement statistical/econometric methods from scratch. You could also find implementation of machine learning methods [here](https://brbisheng.github.io/algorithms/).

###  First Paper: [Nonparametric seemingly unrelated regression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440760000018X) 
> When we deal with `simultaneous equations model`, we usually use `Feasible Generalized NLS` to estimate the model. However, this method requires strong assumption on the parameter structure of the model. This paper is a remedy, published at 2000. Surprising, since then, there is no big advance. How is the quality of this paper? I have implemented the algorithms, and let us have a look at that.</p>

According to my experiecnce, 

1. We should not believe everything research articles say, sometimes they also make mistakes. 

2. Try to verify their methods by ourselves, do things from scratch. The best way of learning is do it ourselves.

3. Do not spend all day coding! Do some sports, have a talk with friends, one will work better.
