Recently, I started a (long-term) freelance project: Algorithms from scratch. This page is dedicated to implement statistical/econometric methods from scratch. You could also find implementation of machine learning methods [here](https://brbisheng.github.io/algorithms/).

Warmups: (forthcoming)
1. Keywords: Nonparametric (Np) regression
    - comments: kNN, kernel methods, regulation, many things are related to Np regression.
    

Academic Papers:

1. Keywords of First Topic: `Nonparametric`, `seemingly unrelated regression (or SUR)` 
    - Paper 1 : [Nonparametric seemingly unrelated regression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440760000018X) 
      * > When dealing with `simultaneous equations model`, we usually use `Feasible Generalized NLS` to estimate the model. However, this method requires strong assumption on the parameter structure of the model. This paper is a remedy, published at 2000. Surprising, since then, there is no big advance. How is the quality of this paper? I have implemented the algorithms, and let us have a look at that.
