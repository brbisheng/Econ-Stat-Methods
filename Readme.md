Recently, I started a (long-term) freelance project: Algorithms from scratch, where I use R or Python to

implement statistical/econometric methods from scratch,
write the machine learning algorithms from scratch.
According to my experiecnce,

We should not believe everything research articles say, sometimes they also make mistakes.

Try to verify their methods by ourselves, do things from scratch. The best way of learning is do it ourselves.

Do not spend all day coding! Do some sports, have a talk with friends, you will work better! I am very serious about this.. Now we start...

Econometrics | Statistics Project: Nonparametric regression
