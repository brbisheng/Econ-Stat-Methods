Forewords:

1. Recently, I started a **(long-term)** freelance project: Algorithms from scratch. This page is dedicated to implement statistical/econometric methods from scratch. You could also find implementation of machine learning methods [here](https://brbisheng.github.io/algorithms/).

2. So what I do is to transform all my understandings of the statistical/econometric methods from **academic papers** and **text books** to code. Why? Many of the papers do not provide code, but just give algorithmes. 20% of the time, when I try to implement their methods by myself, I often find mistakes. So, let us just do it from scratch for the sake of better understanding them and inventing our own methods.

3. This site is still under construction, the structure may vary, but I try to work diligently to make it indeed a **long-term** project and a place useful for people.  

> Update 10/14/2018: I am updating the sites from .markdown to .html, so many parts are unorganized for this moment, I will try to fix the issues as soon as I could.

Warmups: (forthcoming)
1. Keywords: Nonparametric (Np) regression
    - comments: kNN, kernel methods, regulation, many things are related to Np regression.
    

Academic Papers:

1. Keywords of First Topic: `Nonparametric`, `seemingly unrelated regression (or SUR)` 
    - Paper 1 : [Nonparametric seemingly unrelated regression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440760000018X) 
      * > When dealing with `simultaneous equations model`, we usually use `Feasible Generalized NLS` to estimate the model. However, this method requires strong assumption on the parameter structure of the model. This paper is a remedy, published at 2000. Surprising, since then, there is no big advance. How is the quality of this paper? I have implemented the algorithms, and let us have a look at that.
