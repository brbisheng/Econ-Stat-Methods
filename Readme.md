(When I was implementing the methods, I was quite concerned with efficiency issues, especially for non-parametric methods. So currently I am having courses on algorithms. I will come back and continue the update, I am very thankful for people who contacted me and gave me suggestions. If you encountered some difficulties in implementing your econometric/statistical methods, you are very welcomed to contact me through linkedin!)

Forewords:

1. This page is dedicated to implementing statistical/econometric methods from scratch. You could also find implementation of machine learning methods [here](https://brbisheng.github.io/algorithms/).

2. So what I do is to transform all my understandings of the statistical/econometric methods from **academic papers** and **textbooks** to code. Why? Many of the papers do not provide code. When I try to implement their methods, for 20% of the time I could find mistakes. Thus trying to write algorithms from scratch could help with our understanding and inventing our own methods.  

> Update: I am updating the sites from .markdown to .html, so many parts are unorganized for this moment, I will try to fix the issues as soon as I could.
> 11/12/2018: Fixing speed issues for CDF bandwidth selection. The solution is combine C++ and R.
> ### Everything is tested, but if there is any inconsistency, I appreciate that you let me know, and any comments and spotted mistakes would be important. Thank you.

2. Keywords: Nonparametric (Np) regression
    - comments: kNN, kernel methods, regulation, many things are related to Np regression.
    

APPLICATIONS:

1. Keywords of First Topic: `Nonparametric`, `seemingly unrelated regression (or SUR)` 
    - Academic Paper 1 : [Nonparametric seemingly unrelated regression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440760000018X) 
      * > When dealing with `simultaneous equations model`, we usually use `Feasible Generalized NLS` to estimate the model. However, this method requires strong assumption on the parameter structure of the model. This paper is a remedy.
      * [Implementation part 1: estimation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/brbisheng/Econ-Stat-Methods/blob/master/Nonparametric/Paper1/np_sur_part_1.html). This is generated by Rmarkdown, some mathematical formula can not be displayed properly. But it should be very clear to recover them if you follow closely the paper.
      * [Implementation part 2: results evaluations. (working on progress)]()
    - Academic Paper 2:
